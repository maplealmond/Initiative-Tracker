This is an initiative tracker designed for 4e D&D.  You can add monsters or players with the obvious buttons.  The person with the highest initiative is at the top of the list.

Pressing the X button will remove a player or monster from the list.  Pressing the ... will cause a player to hold or ready an action.  They will be inserted back into the cycle if a full turn goes by.

The project contains some amount of code from the shoes-initiative-tracker project, by Marco Antônio Minetto Pompei.  The original copyright notice is reproduced, unmodified, below.
